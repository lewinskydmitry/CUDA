# Summary: 
This project was developed for the "GPU computing class" at UGA and focuses on improving computations for linear and logistic regression as well as matrix operations. It includes a matrix class used for all computations, GPU matrix operations, and implementations of linear and logistic regression using C++ and CUDA.

# Description:

This repository contains the code for my "GPU computing class" project at UGA. The goal of the project was to improve computations for linear and logistic regression as well as matrix operations. The project consists of several folders:

The matrix folder contains the matrix class, which is used for all computations in the project. This class serves as the foundation for the entire project.

The Matrix operation folder contains several GPU matrix operations, including transposition, multiplication, substitution, and more. These operations are optimized for GPU computation.

The Linear regression and Logistic regression folders contain implementations of linear and logistic regression using C++ and CUDA. All computations, including computing loss and matrix multiplications, are performed on the GPU for improved performance.

The Cuda project folder contains code for testing the algorithms and includes sample input data.
